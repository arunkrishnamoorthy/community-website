                "description": "Gen AI (LLM) Operating System for Business The Motherboard: At the heart of this operating system is the motherboard, serving as the central hub that connects and integrates specialized agents or assistants for various modules and departments within an enterprise. These agents cover key areas such as HR, Procurement to Pay, Supply Chain Management, Order to Cash, Accounts Payable, and Accounts Receivable. The motherboard ensures seamless communication and coordination among these agents, creating a unified and efficient operational environment. The Brain (CPU): These agents or assistants will connect to dedicated or shared AI/ML tools. Examples include SCM Demand Sensing for supply chain predictions, Duplicate Vendor Invoice checks in PTP, Common Data Anonymization, Sentiment Analysis, a common service IT ticketing solution, and a departmental policy document search. This integrated approach allows enterprise tools to cross-connect when necessary, enhancing collaboration and data utilization across departments. The Memory (RAM/Disk): Agents will have access to and operate on data sourced from various modules and departments within the backend systems like ECC or S/4 HANA. This ensures that the agents have the most up-to-date information, enabling accurate and timely decision-making. The I/O: Business users or IT consultants will interact with these agents through multiple interfaces. These could include writing in chat, voice interactions, interpreting handwritten diagrams or instructions, visualizing objects (such as products or barcodes), and making critical business decisions. This multi-interface approach ensures that users can engage with the system in the most convenient and efficient manner for their specific needs. The Delegator: A powerful component of this operating system is the ability to delegate tasks efficiently. For example, emails received by the business can be automatically analyzed and assigned to the most suitable agent based on the content and context of the email. This ensures that tasks such as customer inquiries, invoice processing, or support tickets are promptly handled by the appropriate department, improving responsiveness and operational efficiency. The Cross-Agent Collaboration: Agents within the system can collaborate seamlessly, sharing data and insights to perform complex operations. For instance, if a procurement issue also involves supply chain management and finance, the respective agents can work together to provide a comprehensive solution. This cross-agent collaboration ensures that all aspects of a task are addressed holistically. In summary, the Gen AI (LLM) Operating System for Business aims to create a highly integrated, intelligent, and user-friendly environment where various business functions are managed by specialized agents. These agents are supported by advanced AI/ML tools, interconnected data sources, and versatile user interfaces, providing a robust solution for modern enterprise management.",

                "description": "Creating business test data, including both master and transaction data, using OData APIs presents challenges for organisations due to the complexity of error messages returned by the APIs. When errors occur during the data creation process, understanding the root cause becomes cumbersome and time-consuming, leading to delays in test data preparation and subsequent solution finding. This problem statement can be effectively addressed through the implementation of a cloud-based Generative AI-based BTP service. This innovative solution leverages LLMs and RAG to analyze error messages, identify root causes, and provide actionable insights for resolution. In session, we would like to take the audience on our development journey with BTP and Gen AI and share our experience in building mentioned service.",
